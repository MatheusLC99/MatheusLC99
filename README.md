# Hi, I'm Matheus 👋
### AI-Driven Product Engineer • System Builder • Creator of EMPE Framework

I design and build architecture-first software systems using AI-driven workflows.

My focus is not just writing code —  
it's creating structured engineering environments where AI becomes a reliable execution engine.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build full-stack platforms
- Design internal systems and operational tools
- Create architecture-first AI development workflows
- Develop real production solutions focused on usability and scalability

I believe the future of software engineering belongs to developers who know how to **structure AI**, not just use it.

## 🧠 EMPE — AI Engineering Framework

Creator of **EMPE (Structure → Map → Plan → Execute)**  
An AI-native engineering workflow designed to transform ideas into deterministic execution pipelines.

EMPE introduces:

- artifact-driven context
- layered architecture planning
- role-based AI interaction
- execution pipelines instead of random prompting

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

Architecture before implementation.

Context before prompts.

Systems before features.

AI is not a replacement for engineers —  
it is an amplifier for those who design with structure.
